            <p class="project-description">Pokepython is a fan made Pokémon game developed by me, is an text RPG game
                where you can catch, train and battle Pokémon. I developed this game using Python for my first ever personal project.
                this game was an idea that a friend of mine gave me, he said that would be a great way of getting used
                to the Python language, and he was right, I learned a lot from this project and was able to ge through
                the programming basics of Python.

            <p class="project-description">
                PongGame was a Project that me and a couple of friends did for a college project, we had to develop a game
                using the Java language, and we decided to do a Pong game, we had a lot of fun developing this game, and
                we learned a lot about Java and game development in general. We had to implement a lot of features such as
                the ball speed increasing over time, the ball bouncing off the paddles, and the paddles moving up and down.
                It was great to learn about java interfaces and how to implement them in a game.

            <p class="project-description">
                Alt + F4 is a group developed project that me and a couple of friends did for a college project, we had to develop a website
                using node.js for the backend and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend, we decided to do a website that would
                be a Ecomerce website for buying computer parts, we used MySQL for the database and we had to implement a lot of features
                such as the user being able to add products to the cart, the user being able to create an account and login, and the user
                being able to see the products that are available for sale. It was a great experience to learn about web development and
                how to implement a website from scratch.
